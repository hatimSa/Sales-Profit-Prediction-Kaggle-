# 📈 Sales Profit Prediction (Kaggle)

This project focuses on analyzing sales and profitability data from a "Superstore"-style dataset to identify the key factors impacting profits and losses. It is a hands-on **machine learning** mini-project involving data exploration, preprocessing, and predictive modeling.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `Sample - Superstore.csv` – The dataset
- `etude_profit_superstore.py` – Main analysis and prediction script
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze sales data (by product, region, category, etc.)
- Understand relationships between features and profit
- Build a regression model to predict profit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hatimSa/Sales-Profit-Prediction-Kaggle-.git
   cd Sales-Profit-Prediction-Kaggle-
   
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script:
   python etude_profit_superstore.py

## 📊 Expected Output

- Visual insights on regional and product-based sales performance
- Identification of key loss drivers
- A regression model to estimate profit based on various features
